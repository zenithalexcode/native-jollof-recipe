# 🍚 Native Jollof Rice & Peppered Goat Meat Recipe

A clean, semantic HTML project documenting a traditional Nigerian recipe. This project was built entirely from scratch during my first week of intensive Frontend Development study.

## 🚀 The Challenge
This project was a personal test to move away from "vibe coding" and focus on manual code logic. I built this using only my notebook and the HTML fundamentals I learned in my first 4 days, avoiding AI assistance to ensure I truly mastered the syntax.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* Semantic Structure: Utilized <main>, <h3>, and <ol> to ensure the recipe is structured logically for screen readers and SEO.
* Navigation: Implemented an external video tutorial link using target="_blank" for a better user experience (keeping the recipe open while watching).
* Media Integration: Managed image embedding with alt text for accessibility and defined width/height attributes to prevent layout shift.
* Clean Lists: Used ordered lists (`<ol>`) to handle 25 distinct cooking steps, maintaining clean indentation and readability.

## 💡 What I Learned
1. The Importance of Boilerplate: Understanding how the <head> and <body> work together to host content.
2. Accessibility: Using alt tags on images and descriptive text for links so everyone can enjoy the recipe.
3. Patience & Logic: Manually structuring 25 steps taught me the discipline required for long-form content formatting.
